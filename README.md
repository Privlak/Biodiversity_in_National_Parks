The "**biodiversity.pdf**" is the file to read. It is essentially the same as "biodiversity.ipynb", only in PDF format.

The "**biodiversity.ipynb**" contains all the information and code for the project.<br>
The "**biodiversity.csv**" contains the cleaned and merged data from "**observations.csv**" and "**species_info.csv**", which was curated by **National Parks Service** (https://www.nps.gov/index.htm).

<br>

The **objective** of this project was to **analyze the biodiversity data** in order to **better understand the level of endangerment of certain species in various parks** along with the **frequency of their sightings**.

<br>

**Endangered species are living organisms, both plants and animals, that face a high risk of extinction**. 
<br>These species encounter significant threats caused by diverse factors such as habitat loss, climate change, pollution, poaching, and the introduction of invasive species.
<br>The declining population numbers of these species raise serious concerns about the delicate equilibrium of **biodiversity** on our planet.

**Biodiversity encompasses the remarkable array of life forms, ranging from microorganisms to plants, animals, and entire ecosystems**. 
<br>It encompasses the intricate network of interactions between different species and their surrounding environment. Therefore, it plays a critical role in sustaining the health and functionality of ecosystems, which, in turn, supports life on Earth.

<br>

**The conservation of biodiversity is crucial for ensuring the continued well-being of our planet and the future of all living beings.**
